Prediction  Models  of  Default  Payments  of  Credit  Card  Clients  in  Taiwan

This  paper  explores  and  evaluates  binomial  classification  prediction  models  to  predict  the  probability  of  the  credit  card  customers  defaulting  on  their  payments.  It  is  based  on  the  dataset  that  contains  30000  credit  card  clients  in  Taiwan  from  April  2005  to  September  2005.  The  dataset  is  characterised  by  25  variables  covering  demographic,  credit,  history  of  payment  and  bill  statements  data.  After  an  extensive  process  of  data  exploration  and  experiments  including  the  addition  of  several  new  observations  to  mimic  the  real-world  consumer  behaviours,  the  final  model  presented  an  improved  predictive  power,  while  also  indicating  the  potential  for  the  future  work
